            <h2>What counts as an appearance for a character?</h2>
          </Title.Medium>
          <Text.P>
            Variants, reprints, 2nd printings, ashcans, and magazines do not count as an appearance for a character.
          </Text.P>
          <Text.P>
            Standard issues, original graphic novels, and prestige issues count as appearances, as well as issues by
            other publishers for characters, such as crossovers or when Marvel was named Timely Comics.
          </Text.P>
          <Title.Medium>
            <h2>What counts as an alternate reality for a character?</h2>
          </Title.Medium>
          <Text.P>
            For Marvel, any appearance for a character that is not their main 616 counterpart is considered an alternate
            reality appearance.
          </Text.P>
          <Text.P>
            For DC, it's a little complicated because the main universe changes frequently, so the current, main
            universe of DC counts as its main universe, and the rest count as alternate realities.
          </Text.P>
          <Title.Medium>
            <h2>How accurate is the information?</h2>
          </Title.Medium>
          <Text.P>
            The trend for the graph of the character's appearances is going to be more accurate than the absolute number
            of issues that a character has actually appeared in. But if anything missing, it would be very small cameo
            or background appearances in which the character doesn't even talk.

            <h2>What technologies does the site use?</h2>
          </Title.Medium>
          <Text.P>
            The backend responsible for gathering all the issues and serving the character info is written in Golang and
            uses Postgres and Redis for persistence.
          </Text.P>
          <Text.P>
            The frontend is a React app with NextJS and Node. It communicates with the Golang REST API that efficiently
            serves the character data!

          <Text.P>
            The Golang application efficiently scrapes multiple APIs and websites to gather the character and issue
            data.
